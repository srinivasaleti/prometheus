- Prometheus pull based metric monitoring system. Pulls metrics over http from setup applications/systems we wanted to monitor (targets).
- Developed in go
  # Prometheus Architecture

![Architecture](https://prometheus.io/assets/architecture.png)

## Prometheus Server
- **Core component** of the monitoring system, responsible for scraping metrics from targets using a pull model.
- **Scraping:** Collects metrics periodically based on the configured scrape interval.
- **Data Retrieval Worker:** Sends HTTP requests to targets to collect metrics.
- **Time Series Database (TSDB):** Stores metrics in a time-series format.
- **HTTP Server:** Allows querying of stored metrics via PromQL using HTTP requests.

## Exporters
- **Middleware between Prometheus and target systems.**
- Extracts, transforms, and exposes metrics from target systems via an HTTP endpoint (default `/metrics`) for Prometheus to scrape.
- Prometheus provides client libraries (Go, Node.js, Java, etc.) to expose application-specific metrics.
- Agents are typically installed on Linux systems to collect system metrics.

## Pushgateway
- **Used for short-lived or batch jobs** that cannot be scraped.
- Pushes metrics to Prometheus, complementing the pull-based model.

## Alertmanager
- Handles alerts generated by Prometheus.
- Routes, groups, and processes alerts, sending them to various notification channels (email, chat, incident management tools).
- Prometheus triggers alerts; Alertmanager handles notifications.

## Service Discovery
- **Automates the discovery of monitoring targets**, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
- Dynamically updates the list of targets based on changes in the environment.

## PromQL
- **Query language** for retrieving time-series data from Prometheus.
- Tools like Grafana use PromQL to visualize metrics.

## Visualization
- **Prometheus Web UI:** Provides a basic interface for querying and exploring metrics.
- **Grafana:** Popular visualization tool used with Prometheus, offering advanced dashboards and visualization capabilities.
